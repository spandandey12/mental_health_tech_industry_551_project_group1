# Dashboard Proposal: Mental Health in the Tech Industry
## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data science team developing a public facing data visualization tool.

**Target audience:** Individuals interested in understanding mental health trends in the technology industry, including students, tech workers, and the general public.


The tech industry is known to be an environment of speed, long working hours, and high performance demands, which can lead to mental health issues. Though there is much discussion about mental health in the workplace, it is hard to really grasp how company size, benefits availability, remote working, and workplace cultures influence reported mental health.

In order to bridge this existing gap, we are planning to develop an interactive dashboard that would allow users to explore the trends available within the Mental Health in Tech survey data. The proposed dashboard would enable users to filter and compare the information pertaining to mental health and work-related attributes. This would not only raise the overall awareness and provide a platform to engage in an informed discussion on the topic.
