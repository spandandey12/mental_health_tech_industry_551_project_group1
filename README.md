# Mental Health in the Tech Industry Dashboard

## App Overview

This project presents an interactive dashboard designed to explore mental health attitudes, workplace culture, and organizational support within the technology industry. The dashboard is intended for Human Resources (HR) professionals, people operations teams, and organizational decision-makers who are interested in improving employee wellbeing and mental health support initiatives.

Using survey data from the Mental Health in Tech Survey, the dashboard allows users to examine how factors such as company size, geographic region, and workplace openness toward mental health relate to employees’ willingness to discuss mental health issues and seek treatment. The application emphasizes exploratory analysis rather than prediction, enabling users to compare patterns across different subsets of the data.

The interface consists of multiple coordinated visualizations, including bar charts and stacked bar charts summarizing mental health benefits, perceived workplace support, and treatment-seeking behavior. Users can interact with the dashboard through dropdown menus and other controls to filter the data by variables such as company size, region, gender, and survey year. Interactions in one visualization dynamically update the others, supporting both inter-plot and intra-plot exploration.

Overall, the dashboard aims to support evidence-based decision making by helping organizations identify gaps in mental health support, benchmark their practices against industry trends, and generate insights that can inform workplace policy and culture improvements.
