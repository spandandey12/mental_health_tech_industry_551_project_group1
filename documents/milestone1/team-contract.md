  - Dashboard design and visualization
  - Application development and deployment
  - Documentation and writing
- Responsibilities will be discussed and agreed upon before each milestone.

  - GitHub Issues and Pull Requests (for technical tasks)

- Team members are expected to respond to messages within a reasonable time frame (usually within 24 hours on weekdays).
